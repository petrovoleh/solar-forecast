                <h2>Solar Energy Forecasting Platform</h2>
                <p>
                    This project is part of a bachelorâ€™s thesis aimed at developing an advanced platform for forecasting
                    solar energy production. The system combines cutting-edge machine learning models with modern web
                    technologies to provide a reliable and user-friendly tool for optimizing solar energy use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The primary goal of this platform is to support solar energy operators, researchers, and enthusiasts
                    by offering precise energy generation predictions based on weather data, satellite imagery, and
                    historical solar output. This data can help improve grid stability, enhance energy efficiency, and
                    aid in planning renewable energy strategies.
